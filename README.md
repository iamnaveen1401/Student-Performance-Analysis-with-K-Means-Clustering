# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis with K-Means Clustering

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes **student performance** using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm.  
The goal is to group students into clusters based on performance indicators such as **study time**, **test scores**, and **parental education**, helping educators understand different learning patterns.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes details about students’ academic and personal attributes that may influence their performance:

- **Study Time** – Hours spent studying per week  
- **Test Scores** – Performance in exams  
- **Parental Education** – Level of education attained by parents  
- **Attendance Rate** – Percentage of classes attended  

These features are used to find meaningful clusters of student performance.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- **K-Means Clustering** (Unsupervised Learning Algorithm)

## ⚙️ Steps Involved
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Preprocess and normalize data for clustering  
3. Use the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters  
4. Apply **K-Means Clustering** to group students  
5. Visualize clusters to interpret academic performance patterns  

## 📈 Results
- Students are grouped into clusters representing performance levels (e.g., high, medium, low achievers).  
- Insights can help educators develop targeted teaching strategies and support plans.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## 💡 Key Insight
K-Means clustering effectively reveals performance groups among students, enabling data-driven educational improvements.
